### 🎯 The Sovereign Thesis

STIE is an engineered **Unified Inference Hub** designed for NYC Taxi operations. This platform represents an evolution from being "Agnostic" to being **Sovereign**.

In this architecture, the **Business Logic is the Sovereign Power**. We treat the core of the project as a **Sovereign Sanctuary** (Domain Core) with zero external dependencies. All external tools—Google Cloud, BigQuery, and MLflow—are merely **"interchangeable gears" (تروس)** that can be swapped without touching the system's heart.

## 💎 Strategic Core Values

- **Zero Vendor Lock-in:** The platform is **Cloud-Agnostic**, ensuring we own the Intellectual Property completely and can migrate to any environment without friction.
- **Multi-Model Scalability:** Designed to evolve from a single prediction engine to a **Unified Hub** (Duration, Tip, Cancellation) without altering the core infrastructure.
- **Industrial-Grade Reliability:** Protected by a "Sovereign Constitution," the system self-audits and rejects corrupted data instantly via **Universal Invariants**.
- **Economic Optimization:** Powered by the **Polars Lazy Engine** to reduce computational footprint, leading to lower infrastructure costs and higher processing speeds.
- **Institutional Transparency:** Full adherence to the **10-File Documentation Standard** ensures a permanent, audit-ready asset for any global team.

## ⚙️ Engineering & Operational DNA

#### 🛡️ Sovereign Hexagonal Implementation

- **Domain Core (The Sanctuary):** Zero external library imports; contains pure business logic and immutable entities.
- **Application Layer (The Orchestrator):** Defines **Strict Ports** (Interfaces) for data ingestion and inference.
- **Infrastructure Layer (The Laborers):** Implements swappable adapters for Polars, ML engines, and Cloud APIs.

#### ⚡ Performance & Data Integrity

- **Memory Efficiency:** All entities utilize `__slots__` and `frozen=True` (Python 3.12+) for extreme RAM optimization.
- **The Lazy Protocol:** Integration of **Polars Lazy API** with Projection and Predicate Pushdown to optimize query plans.
- **Registry Pattern:** Flexible storage for multiple model outputs using a `Dict[str, float]` within the core entity.

#### 🧪 Quality & MLOps Governance

- **Enterprise-Grade Code Quality:** Managed via **SonarQube** for continuous monitoring of Technical Debt and Security Hotspots.
- **Sovereign Error Taxonomy:** Every failure returns a deterministic code (e.g., `ERR_DOM_VAL_001`) for industrial-grade monitoring.
- **Shield Protocol:** Mandatory **Pre-commit Hooks** enforcing strict linting and safety gates before any persistence.
- **Security & Compliance:** **Mend (WhiteSource)** integration for continuous open-source vulnerability scanning.
- **Static Guardrails:** Strict **Pyright** static analysis to ensure 100% type-safety across the Sanctuary.
- **Test & Logic Integrity:** Enforced via **pytest** and **pytest-cov**, generating automated `.coverage` reports to verify every execution path.
- **Quality Suite:** Advanced stress testing powered by **Hypothesis** (PBT) and **Factory-Boy**.
- **Deterministic Environments:** Powered by **uv project** for reproducible and sovereign dependency management.
- **Model Provenance:** **MLflow** integration for full experiment lineage and automated registry promotion.
